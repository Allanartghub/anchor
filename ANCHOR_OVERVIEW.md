# Anchor: Mental Load Companion for International Postgraduate Students

## What is Anchor?

Anchor is a preventive mental load tracking platform built exclusively for **international postgraduate students in their first 12 months in Ireland**. It's designed to help you spot patterns, identify pressure points early, and stay steady during one of the most challenging transitions in your academic journey.

**Anchor is NOT therapy, counseling, or medical care.** It's a supportive companion that helps you understand what's putting pressure on you before it becomes overwhelming.

## Who is Anchor For?

### Target Audience (The Wedge)
- **International postgraduate students** (Master's and PhD candidates)
- **First 12 months in Ireland** (critical transition period)
- **Any institution** in Ireland

### NOT For:
- Undergraduate students
- Domestic Irish students
- Students beyond their first year in Ireland
- General wellness or productivity tools

---

## The Challenge Anchor Addresses

International postgraduate students face a unique intersection of pressures that are often invisible to institutions and support services:

### The Perfect Storm
1. **Academic Load**: Thesis deadlines, coursework, research expectations, presentations
2. **Financial Pressure**: Tuition costs, high cost of living, balancing part-time work with study
3. **Belonging Crisis**: Homesickness, building new friendships, cultural integration, isolation
4. **Administrative Maze**: Visa complications, immigration stamps, residency requirements, endless registrations
5. **Work-Life Chaos**: Part-time work hours, long commutes, study-work balance struggles
6. **Health & Energy Drain**: Poor sleep, climate adjustment, nutrition challenges, chronic fatigue
7. **Future Uncertainty**: Post-graduation plans, career insecurity, "what comes next?" anxiety

### Why This Matters
- Traditional mental health services are **reactive** (crisis response) rather than **preventive**
- Students don't seek help until they're in crisis
- Early warning signs get missed because there's no structured way to track them
- Institutions lack visibility into emerging patterns across their cohorts

**Anchor fills this gap.**

## How Anchor Works

### Core Experience: The Weekly Check-In (3-5 minutes)

The heart of Anchor is a structured weekly reflection that asks:

**"What felt heavier than expected this week?"**

#### The Flow:
1. **Domain Selection**: Choose your top 1-2 mental load domains (from the 7 fixed areas)
2. **Intensity Rating**: Light, Moderate, or Heavy
3. **Reflection**: Guided prompt to capture what made this week harder than expected
4. **Optional Mood Snapshot**: Capture how you're feeling right now (pairs with check-in data)

This creates a **longitudinal record** of your mental load patterns over time.

---

### Secondary Feature: Ad-Hoc Load Tracking

Between weekly check-ins, you can log pressure anytime—when something specific hits:
- A visa rejection
- An unexpected bill
- A friendship falling apart
- A supervisor conflict
- A health scare

These entries feed into the same tracking system, giving you a complete picture.

---

### Optional Feature: Mood Snapshots

While Anchor's primary focus is **mental load** (not mood), you can optionally log mood snapshots:
- **Daily or weekly** mood capture
- Pairs with your weekly check-in
- Viewable in the **Snapshot timeline** to spot patterns
- Uses simple emoji-based mood buttons (Calm, Okay, Stressed, Low, Angry, Overwhelmed)

This gives you a lightweight emotional temperature check alongside your load tracking.

---

### Optional Feature: Structured Chat

Anchor includes an AI-powered chat interface, but it's **secondary and optional**:
- Accessible after a weekly check-in or load entry
- Can be linked to a specific domain for context
- NOT a replacement for professional support
- Helps you think through what you're experiencing

## The 7 Mental Load Domains (Fixed Framework)

Anchor's architecture is built on **7 fixed domains** that frame all interactions. These are NOT customizable—they're research-backed and designed to capture the full spectrum of postgraduate international student experience.

| Domain | Focus Area | Examples |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| 📚 **Academic Load** | Coursework, research, thesis | Deadlines, presentations, supervisor expectations, research blocks |
| 💰 **Financial Load** | Money, work, cost of living | Tuition stress, bills, part-time work hours, budgeting struggles |
| 🤝 **Belonging & Social Load** | Friendships, community, integration | Homesickness, loneliness, cultural adjustment, making friends |
| 📋 **Administrative & Immigration Load** | Visa, residency, registrations | Stamp renewals, bureaucracy, immigration uncertainty, paperwork |
| ⏰ **Work-Life & Time Load** | Study-work balance, time pressure | Commutes, part-time work conflicts, no downtime, burnout risk |
| 💚 **Health & Energy Load** | Physical and mental energy | Sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, climate adjustment, fatigue |
| 🎯 **Future & Stability Load** | Post-graduation plans, career | Job market uncertainty, "what's next?" anxiety, career decisions |

## What Anchor Achieves

### For Individual Students

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Spot which domains consistently drive load
   - Identify early warning signs before crisis
   - Understand your personal pressure points

2. **Validation & Normalization**
   - See that what you're experiencing is real and legitimate
   - Understand you're not alone in these struggles
   - Feel heard without judgment

3. **Continuity & Reflection**
   - Build a longitudinal record of your journey
   - Reflect on how things change week to week
   - See progress over time (or escalating patterns)

4. **Early Intervention Prompts**
   - Get gentle nudges to seek help when patterns emerge
   - Access crisis resources when needed
   - Take micro-actions to reduce load

5. **Non-Clinical Support**
   - Track mental load without stigma
   - Private, secure, and judgment-free
   - Not therapy—just honest tracking

### For Institutions (Future Phase)

Anchor includes **institutional analytics** infrastructure (anonymized, no PII):
- Cohort-level trends by domain and week
- Early warning system for emerging patterns
- Data to inform resource allocation and support services
- Evidence base for international student interventions

## Anchor's Philosophy

### Stay Steady
Anchor's mission is **preventive support**—helping students stay steady rather than waiting for crisis.

### Not Therapy
Anchor is explicitly NOT:
- Therapy or counseling
- Medical treatment
- Crisis intervention (though it provides crisis resource links)
- A replacement for professional mental health support

### Privacy First
- Your data is **private and secure**
- Never shared with third parties
- You can delete your account and all data anytime
- Institutional analytics are fully anonymized

### Honest & Lightweight
- No clinical jargon
- Quick interactions (3-5 minutes for weekly check-in)
- Emoji-based and human-centered UI
- Built for students, not clinicians

---

## Why Anchor Succeeds Where Others Fail

### Traditional Mental Health Services
- **Reactive** (wait for crisis)
- **High barrier to entry** (stigma, long waitlists)
- **One-size-fits-all** (not tailored to international postgrad experience)

### General Wellness Apps
- **Too broad** (not specific to your challenges)
- **Productivity-focused** (miss the human context)
- **No institutional visibility** (can't inform systemic change)

### Anchor's Approach
- **Preventive** (track before crisis)
- **Low barrier** (lightweight, non-clinical)
- **Hyper-specific** (built for your exact demographic)
- **Systemic impact** (data can inform institutional support)
